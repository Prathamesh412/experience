yahoo css reset api call reset from yahoo....remember put it before the the stylesheet we have linked so that it does not override our code.

This is important because it will override all the features implemented by user agent ie the browser

margin is reference from the outside ie the gap of the element from its extreme ends



border is the second phase and padding is the gap between the border and the content


Position types:--
static:-static will not move
relative:-relative to the div 


whenever we create a element we can create the parent as relative and the child as absolute..So for eg when using a text over an image it will consider the iamge and not the full div.
